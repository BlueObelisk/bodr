This is the Blue Obelisk Data Repository (http://sf.net/projects/bodr/).

The copyright is covered/waived with the Creative Commons Zero waiver,
as given in the COPYRIGHT file.

It represents a set of common, standardized data for chemoinformatics
in both XML and plain-text formats. This data is open for common use,
under the expectation that others will contribute to the repository,
either via tabulations of additional properties or revisions/comments
on existing data.

The concept is that via shared default data, reproducing computational
chemistry and chemoinformatics will become more reproducible :-).

Currently this encompasses:
* Elements directory
  * element names and symbols
  * atomic masses, covalent radii, van der Waals radii
  * Pauling electronegativities
  * electron affinity
  * ionization potential
  * default element colors for viewers
* Isotopes directory
  * exact masses of most abundant isotopes
  * isotopic masses and abundances
  * spin
  * kinds of decay, percentages and energy
  * magnetic dipole moment
  * halflife
