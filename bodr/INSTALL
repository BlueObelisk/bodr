To install the Blue Obelisk Data Repository from source:

1) Get the required applications:

	- autoconf
	- automake
	- xsltproc
	(- intltool, gettext : currently not necessary)

2) Prepare the source directory:
	
	$ sh autogen.sh

	OR by hand:

	$ automake --gnu -a
	$ autoconf

3) Run 
	
	$ ./configure --help

   to get a list of possible configure options (will be explained later in
   README). Please note, that we try to detect paths automatically. If our
   configure script cannot detect them on your system, please write us and
   provide the correct paths for your system.

4) Configure and compile:

	$ ./configure [options-you-like-most-here]
	$ make

5) Install everything:

	$ su
	# make install
